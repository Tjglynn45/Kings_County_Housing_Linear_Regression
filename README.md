PROJECT 2

#Overview
This project, we took a look at the King County Housing Data. King County is the greater Seattle area, to build a model that predicts house prices for homes in the area.
So I will build a linear regression model to predict the housing price to help accurately price homes they represent.
An overview of the average home in the dataset... 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, $540,000, â…“ acre yard, 3 condition (Average), 1 floor, Built in 1971

#Data
King County housing dataset contained data from May 2014-2015.

#EDA
Initial columns provided in the data set include:


id - unique ID for a house
date - Date day house was sold
price - Price is prediction target
bedrooms - Number of bedrooms
bathrooms - Number of bathrooms
sqft_living - square footage of the home
sqft_lot - square footage of the lot
floors - Total floors (levels) in house
waterfront - Whether house has a view to a waterfront
view - view rating of house
condition - How good the condition is (overall)
grade - overall grade given to the housing unit, based on King County grading system
sqft_above - square footage of house (apart from basement)
sqft_basement - square footage of the basement
yr_built - Year when house was built
yr_renovated - Year when house was renovated
zipcode - zip code in which house is located
lat - Latitude coordinate
long - Longitude coordinate
sqft_living15 - The square footage of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors
sqft_lot15 - The square footage of the land lots of the nearest 15 neighbors 

#Conclusion
I repeated multiple linear regression models to get the best possible model for predictions.Using
KBest and RFECV.
